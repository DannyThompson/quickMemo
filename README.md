# quickMemo
This is a work in progress that I started working on in my downtime. Its being done in Kotlin to provide myself with a more realistic
usage of the language, since my only other experience with it was in Unit tests.

This README will be updated as progress is made.

The classes are not organized into packages yet (viewcontrollers, adapters, etc.) but will be once completed.
